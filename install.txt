Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install this library, just place this entire folder as a subfolder in your
Arduino/lib/targets/libraries folder.

When installed, this library should look like:

Arduino/lib/targets/libraries/Tb67H420ftg              (this library's folder)
Arduino/lib/targets/libraries/Tb67H420ftg/Tb67H420ftg.h(the library header file)
Arduino/lib/targets/libraries/Tb67H420ftg/keywords.txt (the syntax coloring file)
Arduino/lib/targets/libraries/Tb67H420ftg/examples     (the examples in the "open" menu)
Arduino/lib/targets/libraries/Tb67H420ftg/readme.txt   (this file)

Building
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After this library is installed, you just have to start the Arduino application.
You may see a few warning messages as it's built.

To use this library in a sketch, go to the Sketch | Import Library menu and
select Test.  This will add a corresponding line to the top of your sketch:
#include <Tb67H420ftg.h>

To stop using this library, delete that line from your sketch.
